			<h2 epub:type="title">The Night of Taras</h2>
			<p>
				<span>By the road the Kobzar sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his kobza played.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like poppy flowers arrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the Kobzar played and sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of many an old old story;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wars with Russian, Pole and Tartar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ancient Cossack glory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He sang of the wars of Taras brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battle fought in the morning early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the fallen Cossack’s grass-grown grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till smiles and tears did mingle fairly.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>“Once on a time the Hetmans ruled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It comes not back again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In olden days we masters were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This never comes again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These glories of old Cossack lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be forgotten nevermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Ukraine, Ukraine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Mother mine. Mother mine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">When I remember thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How mournful should I be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What has come of our Cossacks bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With coats of velvet red?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of freedom by fate foretold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And banners the Hetmans led?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Whither is it gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In flames it went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er hills and tombs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The floods were sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hills are wrapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">in silence grim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On boundless sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">waves ever play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tombs gleam forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">with sadness dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">the foe holds sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Play on, oh sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Hills silent be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dance, mighty wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O’er all the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep, Cossack youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Your fate withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now who shall our adviser be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then out spake Naleweiko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Cossack bold was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After him Paulioha</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like falcon swift did flee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bitter words and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That they trampled on Ukraina</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sure the Poles shall rue.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake the eagle grey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rescue for the faith he wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well indeed the Poles he taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let’s make an end of our woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An end come now to your woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arise, my gentle comrades, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the Poles with blows we’ll fall.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three days of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">did the land deliver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Delta’s shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">to Trubail’s river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fields are covered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">with dead, in course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But weary now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">is the Cossack force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the dirty Polish ruler</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was feeling very jolly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered all his lords together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a time of feast and folly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taras did his Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have a little talk together.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Captains and comrades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My children and brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What are we now to do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hated foes are feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I want advice from you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let them feast away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It’s fine for their health.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the sun descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old night her counsel lends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks’ll catch them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">and all of their wealth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun reclined beyond the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stars shone out in silence still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around the Poles the Cossack host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was gathering like a cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So soon the moon stood in the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When roared the cannon loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To run they found no place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foe they could not face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun beheld the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In heaps all o’er the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With red serpent on the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>River Alta brings the word—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That black vultures after slaughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May feast on many a Polish lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the vultures hasten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty dead to waken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together the Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise to God to offer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While black vultures scream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the corpses fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the Cossacks sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hymn to the night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night of famous story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of blood and glory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night that put the Poles to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while on them their foes did creep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">in open field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A burial mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">gleams darkly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Cossack blood was shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There grows the grass full greenly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the tomb a raven sits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hunger sore he’s screaming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting near a Cossack weeps:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of days of old he’s dreaming.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Kobzar ceased in sadness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hands would no longer play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were wiping the tears away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the path the Kobzar makes his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get rid of his grief he starts to play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the youngsters are dancing gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he opes his lips to say:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Skip off, my children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To some nice warm corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of griefs enough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll no longer be mourner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the bar I’ll go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">and find my good wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there we’ll have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">the time of our life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so we’ll drink away our woes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make no end of fun of our foes.”</span>
