			<h2 epub:type="title">The Night of Taras</h2>
			<p>
				<span>By the road the Kobzar sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his kobza played.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like poppy flowers arrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the Kobzar played and sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of many an old old story;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wars with Russian, Pole and Tartar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ancient Cossack glory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He sang of the wars of Taras brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battle fought in the morning early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the fallen Cossack’s grass-grown grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till smiles and tears did mingle fairly.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>“Once on a time the Hetmans ruled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It comes not back again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In olden days we masters were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This never comes again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These glories of old Cossack lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be forgotten nevermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Ukraine, Ukraine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Mother mine. Mother mine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">When I remember thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How mournful should I be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What has come of our Cossacks bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With coats of velvet red?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of freedom by fate foretold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And banners the Hetmans led?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Whither is it gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In flames it went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er hills and tombs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The floods were sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hills are wrapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">in silence grim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On boundless sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">waves ever play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tombs gleam forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">with sadness dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">the foe holds sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Play on, oh sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Hills silent be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dance, mighty wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O’er all the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep, Cossack youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Your fate withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now who shall our adviser be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then out spake Naleweiko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Cossack bold was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After him Paulioha</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like falcon swift did flee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bitter words and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That they trampled on Ukraina</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sure the Poles shall rue.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake the eagle grey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rescue for the faith he wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well indeed the Poles he taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let’s make an end of our woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An end come now to your woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arise, my gentle comrades, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the Poles with blows we’ll fall.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three days of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">did the land deliver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Delta’s shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">to Trubail’s river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fields are covered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">with dead, in course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But weary now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">is the Cossack force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the dirty Polish ruler</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was feeling very jolly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered all his lords together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a time of feast and folly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taras did his Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have a little talk together.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Captains and comrades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My children and brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What are we now to do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hated foes are feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I want advice from you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let them feast away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It’s fine for their health.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the sun descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old night her counsel lends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks’ll catch them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">and all of their wealth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun reclined beyond the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stars shone out in silence still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around the Poles the Cossack host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was gathering like a cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So soon the moon stood in the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When roared the cannon loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To run they found no place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foe they could not face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun beheld the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In heaps all o’er the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With red serpent on the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>River Alta brings the word—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That black vultures after slaughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May feast on many a Polish lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the vultures hasten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty dead to waken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together the Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise to God to offer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While black vultures scream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the corpses fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the Cossacks sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hymn to the night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night of famous story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of blood and glory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night that put the Poles to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while on them their foes did creep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">in open field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A burial mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">gleams darkly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Cossack blood was shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There grows the grass full greenly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the tomb a raven sits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hunger sore he’s screaming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting near a Cossack weeps:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of days of old he’s dreaming.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Kobzar ceased in sadness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hands would no longer play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were wiping the tears away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the path the Kobzar makes his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get rid of his grief he starts to play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the youngsters are dancing gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he opes his lips to say:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Skip off, my children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To some nice warm corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of griefs enough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll no longer be mourner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the bar I’ll go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">and find my good wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there we’ll have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">the time of our life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so we’ll drink away our woes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make no end of fun of our foes.”</span>

			<p>
				<span class="i1">“Oh breeze there is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor do the waters run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From our Ukraina’s land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perhaps, in council there they stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To march against the Turk demand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We hear not in this foreign land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blow winds, blow across the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bring tidings of our land so free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come from Dnieper’s Delta low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dry our tears and chase away our woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Roar in play thou sea so blue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In yon boats are Cossacks true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their caps above are dimly seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rescue for us this may mean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more we’ll hear Ukraina’s story.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more the ancient Cossack glory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We’ll hear before we die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in Skutari the Cossacks sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their tears rolled down, their wailing rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bosphorus groaned at the Cossack cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he raised his waves on high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shivering like a great grey bull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His waters roaring far and full</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the Black Sea’s ribs were hurled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea sent on great Bosphorus’ cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where the sands of the Delta lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the waters of Dnieper pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In turn took up the mournful tale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The father Dnieper rears his crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shakes the foam from off his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laughter now aloud he calls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spirits of the forest walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hortessa sister river, deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time it is to wake from sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother forest, sister river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come our children to deliver.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the Dnieper is clad with boats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossack song o’er the water floats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“In Turkey over there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Are wealth and riches rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Hey, hey, blue sea play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Then roar upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Bringing with you guests so gay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“This Turkey has in her pockets</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Dollars and ducats.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">We don’t come pockets to pick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Fire and sword will do the trick.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">We mean to free our brothers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“There the janissary crouches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">There are pashas on soft couches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Hey-ho, foemen ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">For nothing do we care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Ours are liberty and glory.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">On they sail a-singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The sea to the wind gives heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In foremost boat the helm a-guiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Brave Hamaleia takes the lead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Oh, Hamaleia, our hearts are fainting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Behold the sea in madness raving.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">“Don’t fear,” he says, “these spurting fountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">We’ll hide behind the water mountains.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All slumber in the harem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Byzantium’s paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skutari sleeps, but Bosphorus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In madness shouts, “Arise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awake Byzantium!” it roars and groans.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Awake them not, Oh Bosphorus.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Replies the sea in thunder tones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou dost I’ll fill thy ribs with sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bury thee in mud, change thee to solid land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps thou knowest not the guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bring to break the sultan’s rest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the sea insisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he loved the brave Slavonic band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Bosphorus desisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in slumber lay the Turkish land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lazy Sultan in his harem slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But only in Skutari the weary pris’ners wept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For something are they waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To God from dungeon praying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the waves go roaring by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, loved God of Ukraine’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To us in prison stretch thy hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaves are we a Cossack band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame it is now in truth to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame it will be at judgment day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For us from foreign tomb to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at thy court, to the world’s surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Show Cossack hands in chains.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i7">“Strike and kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the infidels will get their fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death to the unbelievers all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How they scream beyond the wall!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They’ve heard of Hamaleia’s fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skutari maddens at his name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Strike on,” he shouts, “kill and slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the castle break your way.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the guns of Skutari roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foes in frenzy onward pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cossacks rush with panting breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The janissaries fall in death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Hamaleia in Skutari</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Dances through the flames in glee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the jail his way he makes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Through the prison doors he breaks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Off the feet the fetters takes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Fly away my birds so gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the town to share the prey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But the falcons trembled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor their fears dessembled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">So long they had not heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">A single christian word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Night herself was frightened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">No flames her darkness lightened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The old mother could not see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How the Cossacks pay their fee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Fear not! Look ahead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the Cossack banquet spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Dark over all, like a common day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And this no little holiday.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“No sneak thieves with Hamaleia,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To eat their bacon silently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Without a frying pan.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Let’s have a light,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now burning bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To heaven flames Skutari,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With all its ruined navy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Byzantium awakes, its eyes it opens wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With grinding teeth hastes to its comrade’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Byzantium roars and rages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hands to the shore it reaches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From waters gasping strives to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then with sword in heart it dies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With fires of hell Skutari’s burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bazaars with streams of blood are churning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad Bosphorus pours in its waves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like blackbirds in a bush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks fiercely rush.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No living soul escapes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untouched by fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They the walls down tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver and gold in their caps they bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And load their boats with riches rare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Burns Skutari, ends the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warriors gather and come away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their pipes with burning cinders light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And row their boats through waves flame bright.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oh my lofty hills—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet not so lofty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But beautiful ye are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sky-blue in the distance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Older than old Pereyaslav,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the tombs of Vebla,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like those clouds that rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the Dnieper.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I walk with quiet step,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch the wonders peeping out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the clouds march silently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarped cliff and bush and solitary tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White cottages creep forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like children in white garments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Playing in the valley’s gloom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And far below our gray old Cossack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Dnieper, sings musically</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the woods.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then beyond the Dnieper on the hillside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little Cossack church</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands like a chapel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its leaning cross.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long it stands there, gazing, waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the Cossacks from the Delta;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Dnieper prattles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telling all its woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From its green-stained windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like eyes of the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It peeps as from the tomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou look for restoration?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expect not such glory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robbed are thy people.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what care the wicked lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the ancient Cossack fame?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Traktemir above the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scatters its wretched houses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a drunken beggar’s bags.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is old Manaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once a Cossack town.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is that the one that used to be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All, all is gone, as a playground for the kings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The land of the Zaporogues and the village</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All, all the greedy ones have taken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you hills, you permitted it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May no one look on you more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cursed ones!—No! No!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not you I curse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But our quarreling generals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the inhuman Poles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forgive me, my lofty ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lofty ones and blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finest in the world, and holiest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me, I pray God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so I love my poor Ukraina,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might blaspheme the holy God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for her lose my soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a curve of lofty Traktemir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lonely cottage like an orphan stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready to plunge from off the height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To loved Dnieper, far below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From that house Ukraina is seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the land of the Hetmans.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the house an old gray father sits.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the river the sun goes down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he sits, and looks, and sadly thinks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas, Alas!” the old man cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fools, that lost this land of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hetmans’ land.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brow with thought is clouded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something bitter he would have said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But did not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Much have I wandered in the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In peasant’s coat and garb of lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How is it beyond the Ural,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the Kirghiz, Tartars?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good God, even there it is better</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than in our Ukraina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps because the Kirghiz</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are not Christians.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much evil hast thou done, Oh Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast changed the people God had made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our Cossacks lost their foolish heads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truth, and the Christian faith.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much blood they shed, their own and others.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were they better for it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bah! No! They were ten times worse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apart from knife and auto-da-fe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have chained up the people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they kill them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh gentlemen, Christian gentlemen!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My grey old man, with sorrow beaten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ceased, and bent his brave old head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The evening sun gilded the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The river and fields were covered with gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mazeppa’s cathedral in whiteness shines;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Bogdan’s tomb is gleaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The willows bend o’er the road to Kiev,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hide the Three Brothers’ ancient graves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trubail and Alta, mid the reeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approach, unite in sisterly embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything, everything gladdens the eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the heart is sad and will not see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glowing sun has bade farewell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dark land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The round moon rises with her sister star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out they step from behind the clouds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clouds rejoiced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the old man gazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his tears rolled down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I pray Thee, merciful God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Lord, Heavenly Judge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffer me not to perish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me strength to overcome my woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To live out my life on these sacred hills:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glorify Thee and rejoice in Thy beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at last, though beaten by the people’s sins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be buried on these lofty hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to abide on them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He dried his tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hot tears, though not the tears of youth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought on the blessed years of long ago</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where was this?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, how, and when?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it truth, or was it dream?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On what seas have I been sailing?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The green wood in the twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden with eyebrows dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moon at rest among the stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nightingale on the viburnum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in silence or in song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praising the Holy God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all, all is in Ukraina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old man smiled—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, it may be—you can’t avoid the truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So it was—they wooed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They parted, they did not marry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She left him to live alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To live out his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The old man was sad again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered long about the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then prayed to God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went in the house to sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the moon was swathed in clouds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus in a foreign land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dreamed my dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if born again to the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In freedom once more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me, Oh God, some time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In old age, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stand again on these stolen hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a little cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring my heart eaten out with sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rest at last, on the hills above the Dnieper.</span>
