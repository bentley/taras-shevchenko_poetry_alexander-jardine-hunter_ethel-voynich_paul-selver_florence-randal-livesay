			<h2 epub:type="title">The Night of Taras</h2>
			<p>
				<span>By the road the Kobzar sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his kobza played.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like poppy flowers arrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the Kobzar played and sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of many an old old story;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wars with Russian, Pole and Tartar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ancient Cossack glory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He sang of the wars of Taras brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battle fought in the morning early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the fallen Cossack’s grass-grown grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till smiles and tears did mingle fairly.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>“Once on a time the Hetmans ruled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It comes not back again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In olden days we masters were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This never comes again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These glories of old Cossack lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be forgotten nevermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Ukraine, Ukraine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Mother mine. Mother mine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">When I remember thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How mournful should I be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What has come of our Cossacks bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With coats of velvet red?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of freedom by fate foretold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And banners the Hetmans led?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Whither is it gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In flames it went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er hills and tombs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The floods were sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hills are wrapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">in silence grim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On boundless sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">waves ever play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tombs gleam forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">with sadness dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">the foe holds sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Play on, oh sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Hills silent be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dance, mighty wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O’er all the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep, Cossack youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Your fate withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now who shall our adviser be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then out spake Naleweiko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Cossack bold was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After him Paulioha</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like falcon swift did flee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bitter words and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That they trampled on Ukraina</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sure the Poles shall rue.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake the eagle grey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rescue for the faith he wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well indeed the Poles he taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let’s make an end of our woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An end come now to your woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arise, my gentle comrades, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the Poles with blows we’ll fall.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three days of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">did the land deliver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Delta’s shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">to Trubail’s river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fields are covered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">with dead, in course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But weary now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">is the Cossack force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the dirty Polish ruler</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was feeling very jolly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered all his lords together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a time of feast and folly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taras did his Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have a little talk together.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Captains and comrades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My children and brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What are we now to do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hated foes are feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I want advice from you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let them feast away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It’s fine for their health.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the sun descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old night her counsel lends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks’ll catch them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">and all of their wealth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun reclined beyond the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stars shone out in silence still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around the Poles the Cossack host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was gathering like a cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So soon the moon stood in the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When roared the cannon loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To run they found no place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foe they could not face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun beheld the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In heaps all o’er the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With red serpent on the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>River Alta brings the word—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That black vultures after slaughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May feast on many a Polish lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the vultures hasten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty dead to waken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together the Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise to God to offer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While black vultures scream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the corpses fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the Cossacks sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hymn to the night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night of famous story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of blood and glory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night that put the Poles to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while on them their foes did creep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">in open field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A burial mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">gleams darkly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Cossack blood was shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There grows the grass full greenly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the tomb a raven sits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hunger sore he’s screaming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting near a Cossack weeps:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of days of old he’s dreaming.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Kobzar ceased in sadness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hands would no longer play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were wiping the tears away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the path the Kobzar makes his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get rid of his grief he starts to play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the youngsters are dancing gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he opes his lips to say:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Skip off, my children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To some nice warm corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of griefs enough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll no longer be mourner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the bar I’ll go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">and find my good wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there we’ll have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">the time of our life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so we’ll drink away our woes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make no end of fun of our foes.”</span>

			<p>
				<span class="i1">“Oh breeze there is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor do the waters run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From our Ukraina’s land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perhaps, in council there they stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To march against the Turk demand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We hear not in this foreign land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blow winds, blow across the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bring tidings of our land so free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come from Dnieper’s Delta low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dry our tears and chase away our woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Roar in play thou sea so blue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In yon boats are Cossacks true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their caps above are dimly seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rescue for us this may mean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more we’ll hear Ukraina’s story.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more the ancient Cossack glory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We’ll hear before we die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in Skutari the Cossacks sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their tears rolled down, their wailing rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bosphorus groaned at the Cossack cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he raised his waves on high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shivering like a great grey bull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His waters roaring far and full</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the Black Sea’s ribs were hurled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea sent on great Bosphorus’ cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where the sands of the Delta lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the waters of Dnieper pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In turn took up the mournful tale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The father Dnieper rears his crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shakes the foam from off his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laughter now aloud he calls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spirits of the forest walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hortessa sister river, deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time it is to wake from sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother forest, sister river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come our children to deliver.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the Dnieper is clad with boats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossack song o’er the water floats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“In Turkey over there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Are wealth and riches rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Hey, hey, blue sea play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Then roar upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Bringing with you guests so gay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“This Turkey has in her pockets</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Dollars and ducats.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">We don’t come pockets to pick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Fire and sword will do the trick.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">We mean to free our brothers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“There the janissary crouches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">There are pashas on soft couches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Hey-ho, foemen ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">For nothing do we care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Ours are liberty and glory.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">On they sail a-singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The sea to the wind gives heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In foremost boat the helm a-guiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Brave Hamaleia takes the lead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Oh, Hamaleia, our hearts are fainting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Behold the sea in madness raving.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">“Don’t fear,” he says, “these spurting fountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">We’ll hide behind the water mountains.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All slumber in the harem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Byzantium’s paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skutari sleeps, but Bosphorus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In madness shouts, “Arise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awake Byzantium!” it roars and groans.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Awake them not, Oh Bosphorus.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Replies the sea in thunder tones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou dost I’ll fill thy ribs with sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bury thee in mud, change thee to solid land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps thou knowest not the guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bring to break the sultan’s rest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the sea insisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he loved the brave Slavonic band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Bosphorus desisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in slumber lay the Turkish land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lazy Sultan in his harem slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But only in Skutari the weary pris’ners wept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For something are they waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To God from dungeon praying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the waves go roaring by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, loved God of Ukraine’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To us in prison stretch thy hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaves are we a Cossack band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame it is now in truth to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame it will be at judgment day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For us from foreign tomb to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at thy court, to the world’s surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Show Cossack hands in chains.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i7">“Strike and kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the infidels will get their fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death to the unbelievers all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How they scream beyond the wall!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They’ve heard of Hamaleia’s fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skutari maddens at his name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Strike on,” he shouts, “kill and slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the castle break your way.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the guns of Skutari roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foes in frenzy onward pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cossacks rush with panting breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The janissaries fall in death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Hamaleia in Skutari</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Dances through the flames in glee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the jail his way he makes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Through the prison doors he breaks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Off the feet the fetters takes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Fly away my birds so gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the town to share the prey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But the falcons trembled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor their fears dessembled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">So long they had not heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">A single christian word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Night herself was frightened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">No flames her darkness lightened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The old mother could not see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How the Cossacks pay their fee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Fear not! Look ahead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the Cossack banquet spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Dark over all, like a common day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And this no little holiday.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“No sneak thieves with Hamaleia,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To eat their bacon silently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Without a frying pan.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Let’s have a light,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now burning bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To heaven flames Skutari,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With all its ruined navy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Byzantium awakes, its eyes it opens wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With grinding teeth hastes to its comrade’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Byzantium roars and rages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hands to the shore it reaches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From waters gasping strives to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then with sword in heart it dies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With fires of hell Skutari’s burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bazaars with streams of blood are churning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad Bosphorus pours in its waves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like blackbirds in a bush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks fiercely rush.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No living soul escapes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untouched by fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They the walls down tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver and gold in their caps they bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And load their boats with riches rare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Burns Skutari, ends the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warriors gather and come away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their pipes with burning cinders light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And row their boats through waves flame bright.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oh my lofty hills—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet not so lofty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But beautiful ye are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sky-blue in the distance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Older than old Pereyaslav,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the tombs of Vebla,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like those clouds that rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the Dnieper.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I walk with quiet step,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch the wonders peeping out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the clouds march silently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarped cliff and bush and solitary tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White cottages creep forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like children in white garments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Playing in the valley’s gloom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And far below our gray old Cossack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Dnieper, sings musically</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the woods.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then beyond the Dnieper on the hillside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little Cossack church</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands like a chapel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its leaning cross.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long it stands there, gazing, waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the Cossacks from the Delta;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Dnieper prattles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telling all its woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From its green-stained windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like eyes of the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It peeps as from the tomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou look for restoration?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expect not such glory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robbed are thy people.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what care the wicked lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the ancient Cossack fame?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Traktemir above the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scatters its wretched houses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a drunken beggar’s bags.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is old Manaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once a Cossack town.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is that the one that used to be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All, all is gone, as a playground for the kings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The land of the Zaporogues and the village</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All, all the greedy ones have taken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you hills, you permitted it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May no one look on you more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cursed ones!—No! No!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not you I curse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But our quarreling generals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the inhuman Poles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forgive me, my lofty ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lofty ones and blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finest in the world, and holiest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me, I pray God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so I love my poor Ukraina,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might blaspheme the holy God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for her lose my soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a curve of lofty Traktemir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lonely cottage like an orphan stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready to plunge from off the height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To loved Dnieper, far below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From that house Ukraina is seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the land of the Hetmans.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the house an old gray father sits.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the river the sun goes down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he sits, and looks, and sadly thinks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas, Alas!” the old man cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fools, that lost this land of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hetmans’ land.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brow with thought is clouded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something bitter he would have said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But did not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Much have I wandered in the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In peasant’s coat and garb of lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How is it beyond the Ural,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the Kirghiz, Tartars?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good God, even there it is better</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than in our Ukraina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps because the Kirghiz</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are not Christians.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much evil hast thou done, Oh Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast changed the people God had made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our Cossacks lost their foolish heads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truth, and the Christian faith.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much blood they shed, their own and others.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were they better for it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bah! No! They were ten times worse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apart from knife and auto-da-fe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have chained up the people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they kill them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh gentlemen, Christian gentlemen!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My grey old man, with sorrow beaten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ceased, and bent his brave old head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The evening sun gilded the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The river and fields were covered with gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mazeppa’s cathedral in whiteness shines;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Bogdan’s tomb is gleaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The willows bend o’er the road to Kiev,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hide the Three Brothers’ ancient graves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trubail and Alta, mid the reeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approach, unite in sisterly embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything, everything gladdens the eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the heart is sad and will not see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glowing sun has bade farewell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dark land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The round moon rises with her sister star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out they step from behind the clouds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clouds rejoiced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the old man gazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his tears rolled down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I pray Thee, merciful God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Lord, Heavenly Judge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffer me not to perish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me strength to overcome my woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To live out my life on these sacred hills:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glorify Thee and rejoice in Thy beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at last, though beaten by the people’s sins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be buried on these lofty hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to abide on them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He dried his tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hot tears, though not the tears of youth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought on the blessed years of long ago</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where was this?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, how, and when?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it truth, or was it dream?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On what seas have I been sailing?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The green wood in the twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden with eyebrows dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moon at rest among the stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nightingale on the viburnum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in silence or in song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praising the Holy God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all, all is in Ukraina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old man smiled—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, it may be—you can’t avoid the truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So it was—they wooed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They parted, they did not marry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She left him to live alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To live out his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The old man was sad again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered long about the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then prayed to God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went in the house to sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the moon was swathed in clouds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus in a foreign land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dreamed my dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if born again to the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In freedom once more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me, Oh God, some time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In old age, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stand again on these stolen hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a little cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring my heart eaten out with sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rest at last, on the hills above the Dnieper.</span>

				<p>
					<span>On a Sunday, very early,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When fields were clad with mist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A woman’s form was bending</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid graves by cloud wreaths kissed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something to her heart she pressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In accents low the clouds addressed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Oh, you mist and raindrops fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pity this ragged luck of mine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hide me here in grassy meadows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bury me beneath thy shadows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why must I ’mid sorrows stray?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pray take them with my life away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In gloomy death would be relief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where none might know or see my grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet not alone my life was spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A father and mother my sin lament.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor yet alone is my course to run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in my arms is my little son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall I, then, give to him christian name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To poverty bind, with his mother’s shame?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, brother mist, I shall not do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I alone my fault must rue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee, sweet son, shall strangers christen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy mother’s eyes with teardrops glisten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy very name I may not know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on through life I lonely go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, by my sin, rich fortune lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thee, my son, to ill fate, was tossed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet curse me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">for evils past.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My prayers to heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">shall reach at last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The skies above</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">to my tears shall bend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another fortune to thee I’ll send.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the fields she sobbing went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gentle mist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">its shelter lent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her tears were falling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">the path along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she softly sang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">the widows song:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Oh, in the field there is a grave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the shining grasses wave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the widow walked apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bitter sorrow in her heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poison herbs in vain she sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereby evil spells are wrought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two little sons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in arms she bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wrapped around in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">dress she wore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her children to the river carried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In converse with the water tarried;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Oh, river Dunai, gentle river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I my sons to thee deliver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’lt swaddle them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">and wrap them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy little waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">will lap them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy yellow sands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">will cherish them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy flowing waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">nourish them.’</span>

					<span>All by themselves lived</span>

					<span class="i6">an old couple fond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a nice little grove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">just by a millpond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like birds of a feather</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just always together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From childhood the two of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">fed sheep together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Got married, got wealthy,</span>

					<span class="i4">got houses and lands,</span>

					<span>Got a beautiful garden</span>

					<span class="i4">just where the mill stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An apiary full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">of beehives like boulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet no children were theirs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">and death at their shoulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who will cheer their passing years?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who will soothe their mortal fears?</span>

					<span>Who will guard their gathered treasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In loyal service find his pleasure?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who will be their faithful son</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When low their sands of life do run?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hard it is a child to rear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In roofless house ’mid want and fear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet just as hard ’mid gathered wealth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When death creeps on with crafty stealth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one’s treasures good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">At end of life’s wandering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are for strangers rude</span>
					<br/>

					<span>One fine Sunday,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in the bright sunlight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All dressed up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in blouses white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old folks sat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">on the bench by the door;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No cloud in sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">What could they ask more?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All peace and love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">it seemed like Eden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet angels above</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">their hearts might read in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hidden sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">a gloomy mood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like lurking beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in darksome wood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such a heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Oh, do you see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever could</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">the trouble be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wonder now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">what ancient sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly sprang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">into their morrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was it quarrel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">of yesterday</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choked off, then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">revived today,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or yet some newly sprouted ire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arisen to set their heaven on fire?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Perchance they’re called to go to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor longer dwell on earth’s green sod.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then who for them on that far way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horses and chariot shall array?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Anastasia, wife of mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon will come our fatal day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who will lay our bones away?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“God only knows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With me always was that thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which gloom into my heart has brought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together in years and failing health,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what have we gathered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">all this wealth?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“Hold a minute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearest thou? Something cries</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond the gate—’tis like a child.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let’s run! See’st ought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought something was there.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together they sprang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the gate running;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stopped in silence wondering.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Before the stile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">a swaddled child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not bound tightly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">just wrapped lightly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">in summer mild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">with fond caress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had covered it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">with her own last dress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In wondering prayer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">stood our fond old pair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The little thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">just seemed to plead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In little arms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">stretched out you’ld read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its prayer,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">in silence all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No crying—just a little breath its call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">“See, ’Stasia!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What did I tell thee?</span>

					<span>Quick, bear it inside,</span>

					<span>To the village I’ll ride.</span>

					<span>God-parents we need for our prize.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">In this world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">things strangely run.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">There’s a fellow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">that curses his son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Chases him away from home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Into lonely lands to roam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While other poor creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sorrowful features,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sweat of their toiling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must much money earn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wage of their moiling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Candles to burn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prayers to repeat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The saints to entreat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For children are none.</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Their joys do now such numbers reach</span>

					<span>God fathers and mothers</span>

					<span>Three pairs of each.</span>

					<span>At even they christen him,</span>

					<span class="i2">And so it goes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For the dear old folk it is no joke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For they don’t know where to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where to set him, when to pet him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the year goes and still Mark grows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet they care for him, you’d scarce tell how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as he were a good milk-cow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now a woman young and bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyebrows dark and skin so white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comes into this blessed place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For servant’s task she asks with grace.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“What, what—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">say we’ll take her ’Stasia.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“We’ll take her, Trophimus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We are old and little wearies us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’s almost grown within a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet he’ll need more care, I fear.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Truly he’ll need care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now, praise God, I’ve done my share.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My knees are failing, so now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You poor thing, tell us your wage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is by the year or how?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What ever you like to give.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“No, no, it’s needful to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s needful, my daughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i5">to count one’s wage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This you must learn, count what you earn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is the proverb—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who counts not his money</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hasn’t got any.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, child, how will this do?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You don’t know us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i5">We don’t know you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll stay with us a few days,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Get acquainted with our ways;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll see you day by day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bye and bye we’ll talk of pay.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“We invite you into the house.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so they to agreement came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young woman seemed always the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cheerful and happy as she’d married a lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who’d buy up villages just at her word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She in the house and out doth work</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From morning light to evening’s mirk.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And yet the child is her special care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever befalls, she’s the mother there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Monday nor Sunday this mother misses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give its bath and its white dresses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She plays and sings, makes wagons and things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a holiday, plays with it all the day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wondering, the old folks gaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to God they give the praise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So the servant never rests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the night her spirit tests.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her chamber then, I ween,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a tear she sheds unseen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet none knows nor sees it all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the little Mark so small.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor knows he why in hours of night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His tossings break her slumbers light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from her couch she quickly leaps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coverings o’er his limbs she keeps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sign of cross the child she blesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her gentle care her love confesses.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Each morning Mark spreads out his hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the Servant as she stands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accepts, unknowing, a mother’s care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only to grow is his affair.</span>

					<span>Meantime many a year has rolled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many waters to the sea have flowed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trouble to the home has come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a tear down the cheek has run.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poor old ’Stasia in earth they laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardly old Trophim’ from death they saved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cursed trouble roared so loud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then it went to sleep, I trow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the dark woods where she frightened lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peace came back in the home to stay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">The little Mark is farmer now.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">With ox-teams great in the fall must go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To far Crimea to barter there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Skins for salt and goods more rare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">The Servant and Trophimus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">in counsel wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Plans for his marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">now devise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">Dared she her thoughts utter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">For the Czar’s daughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">She’d send in a trice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">But the most she could say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">While thinking this way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Was, “Ask Mark’s advice.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">“My daughter, we’ll ask him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And then we’ll affiance him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">So they gave him sage advice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And they made decision nice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon his grave friends about him stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sends them to woo, a stately band.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Back they come with towels on shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere the day is many hours older.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sacred bread they have exchanged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bargain now is all arranged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’ve found a maiden in noble dress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A princess true, you well may guess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such a queen is in this affiance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As with a general might make alliance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hail, and well done,” the old man says,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now let’s have no more delays.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the marriage, where the priest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What about the wedding feast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who shall take the mother’s place?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How we’ll miss my ’Stasia’s face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tears along his cheeks do fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet a word does the Servant’s heart appall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hastily rushing from the room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In chamber near she falls in swoon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The house is silent, the light is dim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sorrowing Servant thinks of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whispers: “Mother, mother, mother.”</span>

					<span>All the week at the wedding cake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Young women in crowds both mix and bake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old man is in wondrous glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all the young women dances he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sweeping the yard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He labors hard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All passers-by on foot and horseback</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hales to the court where is no lack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of good home-brew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All comers he asks to the marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet ’tis true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He runs around so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’d not guess from his carriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though his joy is such a wonderful gift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His old legs are ’most too heavy to lift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Everywhere is disorder and laughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the house and in the yard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From store-room keg upon keg follows after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Workers’ voices everywhere heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They bake, they boil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sweeping toil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tables and floors they wash them all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And where is the Servant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">who cares not for wage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Kiev she is gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">on pilgrimage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, Anna went. The old man pled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mark almost wept for her to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As mother sit, to see him wed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her call of duty elsewhere lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“No, Mark, such honor must I not take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sit while you your homage make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To parents dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mind is clear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A servant must not thy mother be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest wealthy guests may laugh at thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may God’s mercy with thee stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the saints at Kiev I go to pray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet again shall I return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto your house, if you do not spurn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My strength and toil.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With pure heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">she blessed her Mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weeping, passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">beyond the gate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then the wedding blossomed out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Work for musicians and the joyous rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dancing feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While mead so sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of fermented honey with spices dashed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the benches and tables splashed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile the Servant limps along</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hastening on the weary road to Kiev.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the city come, she does not rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hires to a woman of the town;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wages carries water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You see she money, money needs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For prayers to Holy Barbara.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She water carries, never tarries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mighty store of pennies saves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in the Lavra’s awesome caves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She seeks the blessed wealth she craves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From St. John she buys a magic cap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Mark she bears it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he wears it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For never a headache need he give e’er a rap.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then St. Barbara gives her a ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her new daughter back to bring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Fore all the saints</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Then home returns</span>

					<span class="i5">having paid her oblations.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She has come back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fair Kate with Mark makes haste to meet her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far beyond the gate they greet her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then into the house they bring her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Draw her to the table there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quickly spread with choicest fare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her news of Kiev they now request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While Kate arranges her couch for rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“Why do they love me,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And still the Servant her secret kept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet from the hurt of her penance wept.</span>

					<span>Three times have the waters frozen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thrice thawed at the touch of spring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three times did the Servant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Kiev her store of blessings bring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each time gentle Katherine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As daughter, set her on her way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fourth time led her by the mounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where many dear departed lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then prayed to God for her safe return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whom in absence her heart would yearn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was the Sunday of the Virgin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old Trophimus sat in garments white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the bench, in wide straw hat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All amid the sunshine bright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before him with a little dog</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His frolicsome grandson played,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The while his little granddaughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was in her mother’s garb arrayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smiling he welcomed her as matron;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For so at “visitors” they played.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But what did you do with the visitor’s cake?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did somebody steal it in the wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or perhaps you’ve simply forgotten to bake?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For so they talked in lightsome mood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But see,—Who comes?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis their Anna at the door!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Run old and young! Who’ll come before?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Anna waits not their welcome wordy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Is Mark at home, or still on journey?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He’s off on journey long enough,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Says the old man in accents gruff.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With pain the Servant sadly saith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Home have I come with failing breath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ’mid strangers would I wait for death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May I but live my Mark to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For something grievously weighs on me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From little bag the children’s gifts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She takes. There’s crosses and amulets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Irene is of beads a string,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pictures too, and for Karpon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A nightingale to sweetly sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toy horses and a wagon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fourth time she brings a ring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From St. Barbara to Katherine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next the old man’s gift she handles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s just three holy waxen candles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For Mark and herself</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Forgive me, son, of me,</span>
					<br/>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She ceased to speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sudden faintness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Mark did take:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">itself did shake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He roused—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">and to his mother crept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">forever slept.</span>

				<span>Beyond the hills are mightier hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cloud mountains o’er them rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red, red have flowed their streams and rills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re sown with human woes and sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There long ago in days of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Olympus’ Czar, the angry Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wrath did pour on a hero bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On brave Prometheus, he who strove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of heaven to seize for men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On mountain side, in vulture’s den</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He suffered what no mortal pen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May well indite. The savage beak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his hearts’ blood doth daily reek.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the torn heart again revives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To triumph o’er its tortures strives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our souls yield not to grievous ills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To freedom march our stubborn wills.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though waves of trouble o’er us roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves move not the steadfast soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our living spirit is not in chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The word of God in glory reigns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis not for us to challenge Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though life rolls on in toil and tears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though we Thy purpose cannot see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cling to hope ’mid doubts and fears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our cause lies sunk in drunken sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When will it awaken, Lord?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oppressors gloat and patriots weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When wilt strength to us afford?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So weary, then art Thou, Oh God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can’st life to us no longer give?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy Truth we trust beneath the rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believing in Thy strength we live.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our cause shall rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our freedom rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though tyrants rage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Thee alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nations bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through age on age</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet meantime</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">the streams do flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever tinged with blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">they go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the hills are mightier hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cloud mountains o’er them rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red, red have flowed their streams and rills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re sown with human woes and sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look at us in tender heartedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in hunger dire and nakedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forging freedom in unhappiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiling ever without blessedness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bones of soldiers bleaching lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In blood and tears must many die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In faith, there’s widows’ tears, I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the Czars to give to drink.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then there’s tears of many a maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falling so soft in the lonely night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hot tears of mothers, sorrow-laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dry tears of fathers, in grievous plight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rivers, but a sea has flowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A burning sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the Czars who in triumph rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their hounds and gamekeepers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their dogs and their beaters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May glory be!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To you be glory, hills of blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All clad in monstrous chains of frost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glory to you, ye heroes true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With God your labors are not lost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear not to fight, you’ll win at length,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For you, God’s ruth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For you is freedom, for you is strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Holy Truth.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">To the Circassians</h2>
			<p>
				<span>“Our bread and home,” in your own tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Tartar words you dare to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nobody gave it you, your world is young,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So far no one has ta’en it away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nobody yet has led you in fetters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we have wisdom in such matters.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In God’s good word we daily read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But from dungeons where the pris’ners moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Caesar’s high-exalted throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis gilt without, while the soul’s in need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To us for wisdom should you come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll teach you all the tricks of trade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good Christians we, with church and Ikon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All goods, even God, our own we’ve made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But that house of yours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Still hurts our eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we didn’t give it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Why should you have it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These ways of yours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">cause much surprise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We never granted</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">The corn you planted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sunlight, you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">Should pay for, too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, quite uneducated you!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Good Christians we, no pagans needy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sound in the faith, not a bit greedy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If you in peace from us would learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Store of wisdom you would earn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With us what great illumination,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cont’nent ’neath our domination;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Siberia great, for illustration.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s jails and folks ’yond computation.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From Moldavia to Finlandia</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many tongues but nothing said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except for blessings on your head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A holy monk here reads the Bible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tells the story, ’tis no libel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of king who stole his neighbour’s wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the neighbour he robbed of life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king now dwells in paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such folks ’mong us to heaven rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, you creatures unenlightened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be ye not of our dogmas frightened!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our gentle art of “grab” we’ll teach;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A coin to the church and heaven you’ll reach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever is there we can’t do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stars we count and crops we sow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foreigner curse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then fill our purse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people selling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis truth I’m telling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No niggers we sell, I’m not making jokes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just common ord’nary Christian folks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No Spaniards we, may God forbid!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor Jews that stolen goods have hid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So don’t you think you’d like to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such law-abiding folks as we?</span>
